[00:01.22] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ooh)
[00:07.97] 
[00:11.49] Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (Yeah)
[00:25.56] (Yeah, yeah)
[00:30.49] 
[00:35.02] Louder (Louder)
[00:39.32] 
[00:41.34] Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (Uhh, yeah, higher)
[00:49.96] It's like standing in the ocean
[00:51.40] We just rocked Coachella, I gave her of half of the check
[00:54.52] It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
[00:57.75] Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
[01:00.70] Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
[01:04.14] If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
[01:07.33] If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
[01:10.97] First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
[01:14.11] Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
[01:17.03] Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic
[01:20.22] Like floating, if I can't be in time
[01:26.53] I don't know, I don't know (Wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
[01:30.11] In the ocean, I can't be loved
[01:35.94] I don't know a sound
[01:41.99] Standing in the ocean
[01:46.60] Standing in the ocean
[01:51.78] 
[01:56.49] Echoing (Echoing), echoing
[02:01.98] Standing in the ocean (Oh baby)
[02:07.95] Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed
[02:17.15]
